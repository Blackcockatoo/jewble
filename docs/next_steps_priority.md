# Next Steps & Priorities

This document captures the active focus areas for Jewble as the team prepares for launch. Tasks are grouped to clarify sequencing and highlight critical path dependencies.

## In-Flight Initiatives
- Final QA sweep across core loops (breeding, battles, exploration, mini-games) to validate stability and UX polish.
- Performance profiling for the dashboard and Vimana map, with targeted optimizations to ensure smooth play on low-end devices.
- Closed beta onboarding copy and email automation to support tester onboarding.
- Auto-regression test harness (CI + visual diffs) to safeguard against feature regressions.
- Standing up the remaining automated test infrastructure so coverage keeps pace with feature breadth.

## Pre-Launch Priorities
1. **Accessibility & Localization** – Achieve baseline WCAG conformance and provide English/Spanish translations for key flows.
2. **Analytics & Telemetry** – Instrument funnels and anomaly alerts to capture beta insights and surface issues quickly.
3. **Economy Balancing** – Tune resource generation, cooldowns, and rewards based on QA/beta data.
4. **Security Review** – Audit export/import paths and sharing permissions prior to widening distribution.
5. **Compliance & Legal** – Finalize COPPA/GDPR readiness and beta Terms of Service.

## Post-Launch Runway
6. Optional server sync layer for cloud backups and cross-device continuity.
7. Mobile UX optimizations focused on touch targets and gesture handling.
8. Community features such as friend codes and pet showcases.
9. Marketing asset production (gameplay footage, press kit, launch messaging).
10. Monetization experiments exploring cosmetics and booster offerings.

## Notes
- Revisit this list after each QA milestone to capture new findings or reprioritize.
- Track owners and timelines for each item within the project management tool to ensure accountability.
