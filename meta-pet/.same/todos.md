# Meta-Pet Development Todos

## Current Focus: Advanced Features Implementation

### In Progress
- [ ] Breeding system UI (wire up `breedPets`, selection flows, and result preview)
- [ ] Integrate Vimana exploration map into the main dashboard layout

### Recently Completed
- [x] Prime-Tail Crest identity system
- [x] HeptaCode v1 encoding with ECC (42 digits)
- [x] Live vitals HUD with Zustand store
- [x] Sacred geometry visualizations (HeptaTag, SeedOfLifeGlyph)
- [x] Fix build errors and dependencies
- [x] Genome encoding system (Red60/Blue60/Black60)
- [x] Deterministic trait derivation logic
- [x] TraitPanel component with physical, personality, and latent traits
- [x] Genome integration with identity and store
- [x] Visual pet sprite (genome-driven SVG rendering)
- [x] HeptaCode ECC fix (outputs exactly 42 digits)
- [x] README documentation update
- [x] Audio chime (HeptaCode → tones)
- [x] Evolution system (4-state machine)
- [x] IndexedDB persistence with autosave
- [x] Evolution polish – requirement breakdowns, stage lore, and celebration copy
- [x] Persistence enhancements – export/import UX and multi-pet management
- [x] Privacy presets – UI for Stealth/Standard/Radiant modes
- [x] Vimana exploration map component and store logic
- [x] Consciousness battle arena simulation with energy shield loop
- [x] Mini-games panel with memory/rhythm tracking
- [x] Achievement shelf catalog + unlock state

### Next Steps (Suggested Priority)
1. [ ] **Dashboard Integration** – Mount Vimana map, battle arena, mini-games, and achievements panels on the home page with responsive layout sections.
2. [ ] **Breeding System** – Build pairing UI, surface `predictOffspring`, and persist breeding outcomes.
3. [ ] **Privacy Presets** – Connect preset selection to crest/hepta encoding flows and expose them in HUD actions.
4. [ ] **Battle Progression** – Surface opponents log, add cooldown timers, and persist shield state between sessions.
5. [ ] **Mini-game Expansions** – Add rhythm pattern generator + meditation mini-game, sync high scores to achievements.
6. [ ] **Vimana Map UX** – Add fog-of-war animations, anomaly events, and reward tooltips; persist discoveries to saves.
7. [ ] **Breeding Lore & Achievements** – Unlock achievements for lineage milestones and write stage copy.
8. [ ] **Narrative Events** – Rotate daily prompts that affect mood/energy modifiers across systems.
9. [ ] **Testing & QA** – Add unit coverage for breeding calculations, battle probability, and store mutations.
